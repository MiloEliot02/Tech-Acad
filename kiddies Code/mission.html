                <p>
                    At Tech Acad, our mission is to empower the next generation with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in a technology-driven world. 
                    We aim to make coding and technology education accessible, engaging, and fun for children of all ages and backgrounds. 
                    By fostering creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, we strive to prepare kids for a future where technology plays a central role in every aspect of life.

                <h2>How We Plan to Start</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that every child deserves the opportunity to learn and grow in a supportive environment. 
                    To kickstart our mission, we are building a curriculum that combines interactive lessons, hands-on projects, and gamified learning experiences. 
                    Our initial focus will be on reaching local communities through workshops, after-school programs, and online classes, ensuring that no child is left behind.
